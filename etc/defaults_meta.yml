# Unmasking tool config file for defining default unmasking meta
# classification parameters.
#
# These values can be overridden via job-specific configuration files
# You can append % to the names of objects or lists in your job config
# to inherit from this default configuration.
#
# You can use variables starting with $ for values which are defined
# in job.experiment.configurations. The definition consists of a list
# of values for this variable, each representing a separate experiment
# configuration. The specified aggregator will be used to aggregate
# results of multiple configurations.
